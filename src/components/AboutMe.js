                Hello, my name is Chad Courtney. I have recently started taking up classes to start learning coding. I am currently enrolled at UNH's bootcamp, I have been building computers for about 7 years and learning a lot about the hardward that goes into them. I'm an avid lover of eSports and my goal is to work for a professional gaming team. I have followed the League of Legends Champion Series for the last 5-6 years and would love to work in the U.S. If I had to make a choice for a team to work for it would definitely be Team Liquid. They have a great brand and from what I can see an amazing enviorment with incredibly great leaders. By 2022 I hope to be a developer for them in either the States or their facility in the Netherlands!
